=head1 Evaluate Completeness Based on Taxonomic Groupings

This object manages data structures to check genomes for completeness and contamination based on their taxonomic
lineage. The algorithm is simple, and is based on files created by the scripts L<taxon_analysis.pl>,
L<group_marker_roles.pl>, and L<compute_taxon_map.pl> plus the global role-mapping file C<roles.in.subsystems>.

For each taxonomic group, there is a list of roles that appear singly in 97% of the genomes in that taxonomic grouping
and an associated weight for each. Completeness is measured by the weighted percent of those roles that actually occur.
Contamination is measured by the weighted number of duplicates found.

This object contains the following fields.

=over 4

=item taxNames

A hash mapping taxonomic group IDs to names.

=item roleMap

A hash mapping role checksums to role IDs.

=item nameMap

A hash mapping role IDs to names.

=item stats

A L<Stats> object for tracking statistics.

=item logH

Handle of a log file for status messages, or C<undef> if no status messages should be produced.

=item roleLists

A hash mapping each taxonomic group ID to a hash of the identifying role IDs and their weights. (In other words, the key of
the sub-hash is role ID and the value is the role weight).

=back

=cut

=head2 Special Methods

=head3 new

    my $checker = EvalCom::Tax->new($checkDir, %options);

Create a new genome-checker object.

=over 4

=item checkDir

The name of a directory containing the main input file-- C<weighted.tbl> from L<p3-taxon-analysis.pl> and L<group_marker_roles.pl>.

=item options

A hash containing zero or more of the following keys.

=over 8

=item rolesInSubsystems

The name of the file containing the master list of roles. This is a tab-delimited file with no headers. The first column of each
record is the role ID, the second is the role checksum, and the third is the role name. The default file is C<roles.in.subsystems>
in the global data directory.

=item roleHashes

If specified, overrides B<rolesInSubsystems>. A 2-tuple containing (0) a reference to a hash that maps role IDs to names,
and (1) a reference to a hash that maps role checksums to role IDs.

=item logH

Open handle for an output stream to contain log messages. The default is to not write log messages.

=item stats

A L<Stats> object for tracking statistics. If none is specified, one will be created.
