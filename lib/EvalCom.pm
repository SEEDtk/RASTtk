=head1 Evaluate the Completeness of a Genome

This package is the base object for evaluating the completeness and contamination of a genome.  It takes as input a L<GEO>
and a hash mapping role IDs to weights.  Each role identified is considered a universal role for genomes of the type to which
the GEO belongs.  The completeness is the sum of the weights of the roles present over the total weight.  The contamination
is the sum of the weights of the duplicate roles over the weights of the roles present.  Both these numbers are converted to
percentages.

This object is used as a base object for other completeness/contamination evaluators.  The primary difference between the subclasses
is the mechanism for determining which set of roles to use.

The following fields are stored in this object.

=over 4

=item stats

A L<Stats> object for keeping statistics.

=item logH

If specified, an open output handle for a file onto which to write log messages.

=back

=head2 Special Methods

=head3 new

    my $evalCom = EvalCom->new(%options);

Construct a new completeness evaluator.  This method should be called from the constructor of the subclass.

=over 4

=item options

A hash containing zero or more of the following keys.

=over 8

=item logH

Open handle for an output stream to contain log messages. The default is to not write log messages.

=item stats

A L<Stats> object for tracking statistics. If none is specified, one will be created.

=back

=cut

sub new {
    my ($class, %options) = @_;
    # Process the options.
    my $stats = $options{stats} // Stats->new();
    my $logH = $options{logH};
    # Create and bless the object.
    my $retVal = { stats => $stats, logH => $logH };
    bless $retVal, $class;
    # Return the object created.
    return $retVal;
}


=head3 Log

    $checker->Log($message);

Write a message to the log stream, if it exists.

=over 4

=item message

Message string to write.

=back

=cut

    }
}


=head2 Virtual Methods

=head3 Choose

    my ($group, $roleH) = $checker->Choose($geo);

Select the evaluation group for this genome.  The group name and the universal role hash are returned.

This method MUST be overridden by the subclass.

=over 4

=item geo

The L<GEO> for the genome to evaluate.

=item RETURN

Returns a two-element list consisting of (0) the name of the evaluation group and (1) a hash mapping each universal role ID to its weight.

=back

=cut

sub Choose {
    my ($self, $geo) = @_;
    die "Missing Choose function for $self.";

=head2 Query Methods

=head3 stats

    my $stats = $checker->stats;

Return the embedded L<Stats> object.

=head2 Public Manipulation Methods

=head3 Check

    my $dataH = $checker->Check($geo);

Check a L<GEO> for completeness and contamination. A hash of the problematic roles will be returned as well.

=item geo

The L<GenomeEvalObject> to be checked.

=item RETURN

Returns a reference to a hash with the following keys.

=over 8

=item complete

The percent completeness.

=item contam

The percent contamination.

=item extra

The percent of extra genomes. This is an attempt to mimic the checkM contamination value.

=item roleData

Reference to a hash mapping each marker role ID to the number of times it was found.

=item group

Name of the evaluation group used.

=head3 Check2

    my ($complete, $contam, $group, $seedFlag) = $checker->Check2($geo, $oh);

This performs the same job as L</Check> (evaluating a genome for completeness and contamination),
but it returns a list of the key metrics in printable form. If an output file handle is
provided, it will also write the results to the output file.

=over 4

=item geo

The L<GEO> to be checked.

=item oh (optional)

If specified, an open file handle to which the output should be written. This consists of the labeled metrics
followed by the (role, predicted, actual) tuples in tab-delimited format.

=item RETURN

Returns a list containing the percent completeness, percent contamination, the name of the grouping
used, and a flag that is 'Y' if the seed protein is good and 'N' otherwise. The two percentages will be rounded
to the nearest tenth of a percent.
